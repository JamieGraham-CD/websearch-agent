    "response": "There are several popular Chinese methods to cook eggs. Two of the most common recipes include Chinese Tomato Egg Stir-Fry and Chinese Steamed Eggs (Zheng Dan).\n\n1. Chinese Tomato Egg Stir-Fry: \n\u2022 Ingredients: Eggs, ripe tomatoes (cut into wedges or chunks), salt, sugar, white pepper, and aromatics like scallions. Some recipes also add a splash of vinegar and a few drops of sesame oil for extra flavor.\n\u2022 Method: Beat the eggs lightly with a pinch of salt. In a wok or nonstick pan, heat a small amount of oil and quickly scramble the eggs until just set, removing them to prevent overcooking. In the same pan, add a little more oil (if needed) and stir-fry the tomatoes with aromatics until they soften and release their juices. Season with salt, a pinch of sugar, and vinegar if you like. Return the softened eggs to the pan and stir gently, allowing the eggs to absorb some of the tomato sauce without losing their fluffiness. Serve hot with steamed rice.\n\n2. Chinese Steamed Eggs (Zheng Dan): \n\u2022 Ingredients: Eggs, warm water or chicken broth (typically about 1.5 times the volume of beaten eggs), and a pinch of salt. Optional toppings include chopped scallions, a drizzle of soy sauce, or sesame oil.\n\u2022 Method: Beat the eggs with warm water (or broth) and season with salt. For a smoother texture, strain the mixture through a fine sieve to remove bubbles. Pour the mixture into a heat-proof bowl, cover it with a plate or foil to avoid water droplets falling into the custard, and steam over low heat for about 10-12 minutes until the custard just sets. Once done, garnish with scallions or a few drops of soy sauce. The result is a silky smooth and delicate egg custard.\n\nThese traditional techniques emphasize a balance of flavors and textures, hallmark traits of Chinese cuisine.
